IV73-TGT3
I. Core Objective (Per Round):
Be the first player to form and meld three (3) complete sets.
Each of these three sets must be from a different Food Group.
A set (or "meld") consists of three (3) cards and can be formed in two ways:
Three identical Ingredient cards (e.g., 3 "Apple" cards).
One of each of the three different Ingredient cards belonging to a single Food Group (e.g., one "Apple," one "Avocado," and one "Strawberry" from the "Orchard Selection" Food Group).

II. Terminology:
Food Group: The eight broad categories of ingredients (e.g., Orchard Selection).
Ingredient: The specific items within a Food Group (e.g., Apple, Avocado, Strawberry).

III. Deck Composition (Total cards will be 113 - 96 Ingredient Cards + 8 Action Cards + 1 Wild Card + 8 Recipe Cards):
Ingredient Cards (96 cards total):
   There are 8 Food Groups.
   Each Food Group has 3 unique Ingredients. (Total of 24 unique Ingredient types).
   There are 4 copies of each unique Ingredient card.
Action Cards: A set of special cards mixed into the deck that have immediate effects when drawn.
   Total: 8 Action Cards (2 of each of the 4 types above).
   Drawing: Resolved immediately when drawn from the main deck.
   Discarding: The played Action Card goes to the top of the active player's personal discard pile.
Wild Card (1 card total):
   One "Universal Spice" / "Secret Ingredient" card. Acts as any Ingredient card from any Food Group.

IV. Food Groups & Their Ingredients:
Orchard Selection: Apple, Avocado, Strawberry
Garden Harvest: Tomato, Lettuce, Carrot
Golden Grains: Rice, Pasta, Bread
Dairy Delights: Milk, Cheese, Butter
Pasture & Pen: Chicken, Beef, Bacon
Coastal Catch: Salmon, Shrimp, Octopus
Earthy Finds: Potato, Mushroom, Ginger
Spice Rack: Garlic, Onion, Black Pepper

V. Game Setup (Per Round):
Shuffle all Ingredient, Action, and Wild cards together to form the main draw deck.
Deal 8 cards to each player.
Place the remaining deck face-down in the center to form the draw pile.
Randomly determine and announce the "Open Kitchen" special Food Group for the current round.

VI. Player Turn:
Draw Phase: The player must choose one of the following:
Draw the top card from the face-down draw pile.
Draw the top face-up card from any player's personal discard pile (including their own).
Action Phase (If Applicable):
If an Action Card was drawn from the draw pile, its effect is resolved immediately (unless the card states otherwise).
Meld Phase (Optional):
During their turn (typically after drawing and resolving any action), if the player can form a complete set (as defined in Core Objective) with the cards in their hand, they may choose to meld it.
To meld, the player lays the 3 cards forming the set face-up in front of them. These melded cards are considered locked and cannot be returned to the hand.
Win Condition Check:
If, after melding, a player has successfully melded their third set (and all three melds are from different Food Groups), they immediately declare victory for the round. The round ends.
Discard Phase (If Not Winning):
The player must discard one card from their hand face-up onto their own personal discard pile.
Important Discard Rule: Any card(s) already in that player's discard pile that are now covered by this newly discarded card become inaccessible to all players for the remainder of the round (unless the main draw pile is depleted and discard piles are reshuffled). Only the top card of each personal discard pile is ever available to be picked up.

VII. Agreed-Upon Action Card Concepts (Specifics TBD):
   1. Action Card: "Expiration Date" (2 copies in deck)
   * Text: "Choose an opponent. That player must discard 1 card from their hand (their choice) onto their personal discard pile. Then, if their discard pile is not empty, they must take the top card from their own discard pile into their hand. If their discard pile was empty at that moment, they draw 1 card from the main deck instead."
   * Effect: Disrupts an opponent's hand and forces them to potentially take back an unwanted card or a less optimal one.
   2. Action Card: "Fresh Delivery!" (2 copies in deck)
   * Text: "Draw the top 2 cards from the main deck. Add 1 of these cards to your hand. Place the other card face-down on the bottom of the main deck."
   * Effect: Gives the player a better choice of card and some minor control over what's removed from immediate play.
   3. Action Card: "Salvage Operation" (2 copies in deck)
   * Text: "Choose any player's discard pile that currently has at least two cards in it. Take the second card from the top (the card directly underneath the visible top card) and add it to your hand. (The top card of that discard pile remains untouched)."
   * Effect: Allows strategic retrieval of a recently "buried" card, adding a clever way to interact with the discard piles. (Remember: after playing this and taking the card, your hand size increases by one. You will still make your normal end-of-turn discard from your now larger hand).
   4. Action Card: "Potluck!" (2 copies in deck)
   * Text: "Each player (including you) chooses 1 card from their hand and passes it face-down to the player on their left. Add the card you receive to your hand."
   * Effect: A light, all-player interaction that shakes up hands. Could be helpful or slightly disruptive depending on what you pass and receive.

VIII. End of Round & Scoring:
When a player wins the round (by melding their third valid set):
The winning player receives +3 points (Win Bonus).
All players (including the winner) then score points for all sets they have successfully melded in front of them:
+3 points for each set of "three identical Ingredient cards."
+1 point for each set of "three different Ingredient cards from one Food Group."
"Open Kitchen" Bonus: Any player (including the winner) who has a melded set belonging to the round's pre-determined "Open Kitchen" special Food Group receives an additional +1 point. (Maximum of +1 point from this bonus per player, per round).

IX. Draw Pile Depletion:
If the main draw pile runs out of cards before a player wins the round, all personal discard piles are collected, shuffled thoroughly, and formed into a new face-down draw pile. Play continues.

X. Overall Game End:
The game is played over a pre-determined number of rounds (e.g., "4, 5, or 6-course meal").
The player with the highest cumulative score after all rounds are completed is the overall winner of the game.

XI. Open Kitchen Bonus Selection Process :

Dealer & Picker: The dealer rotates each round. The player to the dealer's right is the "Picker."
Timing: After player hands are dealt and the main draw pile is set.
Picker's Action: The Picker draws the top card from the main draw pile and reveals it to all players.
Resolution based on card type:
If an Ingredient Card is drawn:
The Food Group of this Ingredient Card becomes the "Open Kitchen" special Food Group for the round.
The revealed Ingredient Card is then given to the dealer, who inserts it face-down into the approximate middle of the draw deck. The deck may then be cut once by another player.
If an Action Card is drawn:
There is no "Open Kitchen" special Food Group for this round.
The revealed Action Card is given to the dealer, who inserts it face-down into the approximate middle of the draw deck. The deck may then be cut once by another player.
If the Wild Card ("Universal Spice") is drawn:
The Picker immediately adds the Wild Card to their hand.
The Dealer then takes one card at random from the Picker's hand.
This randomly chosen card is given back to the dealer, who inserts it face-down into the approximate middle of the draw deck. The deck may then be cut once by another player.
There is no "Open Kitchen" special Food Group for this round.

XII. Optional Advanced Modules:

Chef's Special Module - Finalized Core Concept:
Setup: At the start of each round, one "Recipe Card" is drawn from a dedicated Recipe Deck and displayed. This is the active Chef's Special for the round.
Recipe Card Content:
   Unique Recipe Name (e.g., "Seafood Paella," "Mushroom Risotto," "Berry Cobbler").
   A list of 8 specific, unique Ingredient cards required. These ingredients should be diverse, ideally spanning multiple Food Groups.
A point value for completion: 12 points.
Player Goal (for this module): To be the first to collect all 8 specified Ingredient cards in their hand.
Winning the Round with a Recipe:
   On a player's turn, if the card they draw (from the main deck or a discard pile) is the 8th and final unique Ingredient needed to complete the active Chef's Special Recipe, and they now hold all 8 required ingredients:
   They declare "Chef's Special!"
   They reveal the 8 Ingredient cards from their hand that match the recipe.
   This player wins the round. They do not make a final discard.
Scoring for Recipe Win:
   The player who completes the Chef's Special scores a flat 12 points for that round.
   This 12-point score is inclusive (it replaces the standard +3 win bonus, and they do not score extra for any "Open Kitchen" Food Group synergy within the recipe ingredients, nor do they score the recipe ingredients as if they were standard sets).
Interaction with Standard Play:
   Players are free to switch their strategy between pursuing the Chef's Special Recipe or collecting 3 standard sets during the round.
   If a player wins the round by melding 3 standard sets, any other players who were attempting the Chef's Special Recipe score 0 points for their incomplete recipe. However, these players do still score points for any standard sets they had successfully melded on the table prior to the round ending.
   No Partial Melding of Recipe Ingredients: All 8 ingredients for a recipe must be collected in hand and revealed simultaneously to win with the recipe.
