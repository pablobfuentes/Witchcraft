🧪 Potioncraft — Game Mode 2 (Draft Rules)
1) Components

Main Deck (136 cards):
108 Ingredient cards • 27 Spell (Action) cards • 1 Wild card (effect TBD)

Potion Decks (15 cards total):
3 separate decks by category — Maleficia, Benedicta, Fortuna (5 cards each)

Player Areas: Hand, Crafting Table (your tableau), Personal Discard Pile

Reveals Row: exactly 3 face-up potions, one from each category

2) Goal

Be the first player to claim 1 potion from each category (Maleficia, Benedicta, Fortuna) — total 3 potions — to win the round.

3) Setup

Shuffle the Main Deck. Deal 9 cards to each player.

Create three Potion Decks (by category). Reveal 1 potion from each deck face-up to the center.

Choose starting player; turns proceed clockwise (unless reversed).

4) Turn Structure

On your turn, complete these steps in order:

Draw

Draw 1 card from the Main Deck or the top card of any player’s personal discard pile.

Exception: you can’t normally draw Spell cards from discard piles (unless an effect explicitly lets you).

Play & Craft (any order, repeat as you wish)

Play any number of Spell cards (Action cards).

Timing: Only on your turn. Once played, they cannot be blocked.

Craft potions (see §5). You may craft multiple in the same turn if able.

Use potion perks: Not on the same turn you claimed them. Perks can be used starting your next turn (see §6).

End Step — Discard down to 9 in your Crafting Table

Your Crafting Table Count = cards in your hand + (3 per potion you have, face-up or face-down).

If the total > 9, discard to your own discard pile until the total equals 9.

If you lost a potion earlier and are below 9, you may skip discarding until your table naturally returns to 9.

Direction & Skips: Some Spells alter turn order (e.g., Reverse) or Skip the next player; apply immediately.

5) Crafting Potions

Each revealed potion lists 4 ingredients; you need any 3 to claim it.

Substitution Rule (by Ingredient Category):
If you’re missing a specific ingredient, you may discard the other 2 ingredients from that same ingredient category to substitute for the missing one.

Substitution consumes those 2 cards (they go to your discard).

This often puts you “down a card,” which you’ll refill via normal draws/turns.

Claiming:

Reveal the 3 matching ingredients (accounting for any substitution), discard all used cards, and take the potion into your Crafting Table face-up.

Immediately reveal a new potion from that same category’s deck into the center.

No Category Repeat within a Potion:
A crafted potion’s internal recipe rule is already enforced at design-time; players don’t need to check extra category restrictions beyond the substitution rule above.

Ties: Only current player can claim during their turn, so no simultaneous claims.

6) Potion Perks (One-time)

Each claimed potion grants a one-time perk.

When usable: Starting on your next turn, before, during, or after playing Spells (as appropriate to the perk).

After use: Flip the potion face-down (perk spent).

If stolen: See §9. A face-down potion remains spent and cannot be reactivated by anyone.

See perks in Potions.txt

7) Blocking Potion Effects (Category Triangle)

Only potion effects can be blocked. Spells cannot be blocked.

If a potion’s effect targets you, you may instantly play 1 Spell as a Block (out-of-turn allowed, the only out-of-turn play). If a player blocks a spell that targets multiple players, it is effectively blocked only for that person. All players have the chance to block.

A Block must follow the category triangle:

Maleficia beats Fortuna

Fortuna beats Benedicta

Benedicta beats Maleficia

Practically: to block a Maleficia potion effect targeting you, you must play a Benedicta Spell (and so on).

Note: In this mode, Spells serve offensive/utility on your turn and can serve as reactive Blocks against potion effects only.

8) Spell (Action) Cards — Quick Reference

(All Spells are played on your turn unless noted as a Block. Once played, cannot be blocked.)

🕯 Circle Breaker — Skip the next player’s turn.

🔁 Twist of Fate — Reverse direction of play.

🐍 Venom Brew — Target player discards 1 random card.

🔮 Astral Projection — Peek the top 3 cards of the Main Deck, keep 1, return the other 2 in any order.

Foul Elixir: Can't go to hand, affects player immediately upon drawing. If given form initial hand, activates as soon as it is the player's turn.

🪄 Crackling Cauldron — You draw 1 extra card and have a hand of +1 until you craft a potion.

Summon from Beyond: Choose any player's discard pile; take 1 card from it.

🕸 Hex Seal — Choose 1 ingredient category; that category is locked for all players (cannot be used to craft or substitute) for the rest of the game or until another Hex seal is placed. Only 1 can be active at a time.

🎭 Thief’s Gamble (Game Mode 2) — Steal a potion from another player:

Choose a target player and one potion in their Crafting Table.

Select 4 cards from your hand and place them face-down (your “wager”).

The target reveals whether they hold any pair of identical Ingredient cards (two copies with the same name).

Success: If the target has a pair, the steal succeeds. You take the potion (face-orientation unchanged).

Both players discard: your 4 wager cards, and the target discards the revealed pair.

Fail (Busted): If the target has no pair, steal fails. You discard the 4 wager cards and lose your next turn.

Counting toward 9: The stolen potion immediately counts as 3 in your Crafting Table; adjust at end of your turn.

Note: Thief’s Gamble’s role is different in Game Mode 1; the above applies only to Game Mode 2.

9) Stealing & Ownership

A stolen potion moves into the thief’s Crafting Table.

If it was face-up, it stays face-up (perk still unused only if it had not been used); if face-down, it stays face-down (perk spent).

Perks on face-down potions cannot be re-used by anyone.

10) Decks, Discards & Reshuffle

Personal Discard Piles: Each player discards to their own pile (face-up).

Other players may draw only the top card of any personal discard pile instead of drawing from the Main Deck.

Exception: Spells cannot be drawn from discards unless a card effect explicitly allows it.

When the Main Deck empties: Combine all players’ discard piles, shuffle to rebuild the Main Deck, continue play.

Potion Deck empty: That category is unavailable for new crafts; the only way to acquire it is via stealing (Thief’s Gamble).

11) Winning the Round

The first player to own 1 potion from each category wins immediately.

If reverse/skip effects alter order, resolve them normally; victory is checked after each complete turn.

12) Edge Cases & Timing Defaults

Random discard/draw: Shuffle the targeted player’s hand face-down and remove cards at random.

Perk timing: Perks can be used beginning your next turn after claiming a potion.



13) Quick Reference: Turn Summary

Draw from Main Deck or any top personal discard (not Spells unless allowed).

Play Spells / Craft (any number, any order).

Spells: only on your turn; cannot be blocked.

Craft: discard required ingredients; substitutions discard the two category cards.

Reveal a new potion from that category after claiming.

End Step: Discard down to 9 in your Crafting Table (hand + 3 per potion).

If a potion was stolen from you, you may skip discarding in future turns until you return to 9.
